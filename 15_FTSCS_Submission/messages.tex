The ERTMS components exchange a number of messages, see Figure~\ref{fig:arch}. As we are dealing with a single geographic region,
controller, interlocking, and RBC are unique. Thus, for most messages
no object identifier is needed:
%
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed]
msgs routerequest, proceedrequest, ... : RouteName -> Msg .
\end{lstlisting}
This is in contrast to messages involving trains. For instance, the message 
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed]
msg magrant : Oid Nat -> Msg .
\end{lstlisting}
grants a movement authority (encoded as a natural number, determining
the position to which the train is allowed to travel) to a specific
train with an object identifier of type \verb|Oid|.
%
Messages are urgent, i.e., their processing time is 0:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed]
eq mte(M:Msg) = 0 .
\end{lstlisting}
