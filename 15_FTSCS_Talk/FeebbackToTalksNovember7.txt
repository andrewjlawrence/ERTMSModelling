Talk was well received.
Meseguer thanked afterwards for explaining ERTMS well.
Advantages of simulation in Real-time-maude; having the Objects present.

General questions:
- Security aspect of RBC, verification of security protocol.
- In China, move to moving blocks (Level 3).
- Comment: Level 3 will never be realized due to using GPS (Ansaldo)
- How many trains modeled. Answer 2, theoretical result that two suffice.


For me: Revise/check, not necessarily to be done now.
1) 40 meter distance, not done in modelleing: Once a train is on AD, another train gets a MA until end of AC. This should lead to an error.
2) Only allow system to go into acc state, when MA is actively extended.
We claim that in justification of non-zenoness, but our modelling just checks the difference. -> +1 needed to avoid scuttering.
3) eat MArequest -> shouldn't it be under a delta?
4) Doublecheck "acceleration/deceleration takes the same distance"- braking is faster.
5) Add README file: to explain order,
                               and which files to try, s
                               different controler
6) would controller cycle of 10 make it faster?

			       
Discussion with Jose:
=====================
- Generalize mte result to timesampling before and after an interesting event;
- use float to compute sqrt.

Discussion with Peter
=====================

- Q: I answered question: why error in sampling error cannot add up. Because at all timetick it is measured precisely, only when the additional measurement is taken...
- Q: why are integers not enough? eg modelling in cms? Because changed of positions has faction (1/2) in it.
- once revised we should send him sources.
- thinks we should not bother about timesampling,  or a theoretical result about it, as long as we can argue that no event is missed.
- approximation to keep size small - do not stress it - float?
- (!) all delta rules should be equations apart from the tick rule.
[Note we are having rules, because the acc rule eg involves also statechanges. This would not be an argument for separating the rules and the equations, but see difficulty below....]
- Q: Could we add train length? Or argue why not needed.
- error injection - why not via simulation, why modellchecking done? Modellchecking seems to be an overkill.


Remark on earlier modelling decisions:
======================================
- Suggestions: Do state changes instantaneously when condition is fullfilled.
I had my reasons, not to do that, but it might be interesting to try out.
Reason: (1) when exactly should this happenen when R is only measured approximately. (2) if in intervall - could then several transitions happened? By doing it explicitely, deterministic behaviour.
- Newton method, to better control approximation?
- error on case: speed = 0 (factor 2) - this might make +1 necessary.
- Truncation could cause error; instead of measuring late, it could happen that we measure before the event.

- Generally, measuring tracksegment transition late, is no problem.
- How is it with starting breaking earlier, this changes the behavior. Should we ask Siemens  when they would be starting to break? Should we start breaking at a full second?
- it is an modellig error not to send a MA request then changing to breaking.


Needed
======
Having good simulations files available.
- trew command (see simulation.rtmaude file, run-all.files)
- tsearch command (see run-train-scen-new.rtmaude (does not load; tsearch?)
- mc commands


Todo:
=====
- check error with distance first.
- answer re delta equation?

We have 2-3 weeks for preparing final version. And invitation to journal submission is agreed.
