MR's wishlist:
--------------

add route cancel messages

clarify the difference to CSP||B modelling with regards to route set,
rout grant

remove the maximal progress assumption

train safety distance, currently 40m - Siemens input to that

discuss with Siemens a good minimal frequency with which a controller
can make route requests

discuss with Siemens what strategies could be reasonable for movement
authority requests from the train

discuss with Siemens the location problem of a train - is there
something better than our abstraction?

validate with Siemens the "information packaging" of routes from the
interlocking to the RBC

train speed: reduced when going over a point in reverse

different line speeds

add an element of capacity

discuss with Siemens that train drivers have to enter specific data on
their trains before starting and that this might be a potential source
of error

choose good names in the model, have a unifying naming scheme on
capitalization

discuss the abstraction level of our RBC with Siemens
