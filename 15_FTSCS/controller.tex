An ERTMS controller issues route requests. For a general safety
analysis, a \emph{random controller} that can make any order of route
requests should be considered:
%
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed]
op randomRoute : -> RouteName .
rl randomRoute => RouteName1A . 
... 
rl randomRoute => RouteName4  .
\end{lstlisting}
%
However, it is also possible to perform safety analysis relatively to
a specific strategy, e.g., a \emph{round-robin controller} that
requests routes as follows -- 1A first, followed by 1B, until route
4, starting over with 1A again:
\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed]
eq routeOrder = (RouteName1A : RouteName1B : ... : RouteName4) .
\end{lstlisting}
%
Yet another parameter are the times at which the controller makes
route requests. For both controllers we work with a constant
frequency.
