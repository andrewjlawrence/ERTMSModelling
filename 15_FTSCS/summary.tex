\section{Summary and Future Work}

In this paper, we have modelled, validated, and verified a complex
system of systems of hybrid nature.
%
%
%
To this end, 
%
we presented an analysis of the ERTMS system,
%
described its information flow,
%
and provided a concise model in Real Time Maude. 
%
This model is astonishingly small: it consists of around only 1000
lines of code. We believe this is due to the advanced concepts,
especially the object orientated features that Real Time Maude offers.
%
Through simulation we have demonstrated that our model exhibits a
number of expected behaviours.
%
Furthermore, by systematic error injection, we have shown that safety
in ERTMS depends on all its components. 
%
This simulation and error injection give us confidence that our model
is valid.
%
Finally, we have presented a number of model checking results that
indicate that, for small rail yards, complexity of model checking of
time-dependent safety properties is under control.

It is future work to explore further, more complex rail yards,
including bi-directional ones. On the practical side we intend to
extend our modelling with further controller strategies and more
complex train progression behaviour. On the more theoretical side, we
plan to investigate completeness and abstraction techniques to reduce
model-checking time, including finitisation.
