DONE: Revised trains model?
I looked through all the rules again, the general conditional behavior
- ok.  The acc cases fuer S=0, and brake->acc, and 0 to acc could be
done better - but I prefer to leave that for now. With regard to
non-zenoness: It would be better to allow transition to acc only when
there is a MAgranted message present.

----------- REVIEW 1 -----------
This paper deals with the formal modeling and analysis in Real-Time
Maude of parts of the ERTMS/ETCS interlocking system for controlling
the movement of trains. The specification is simulated both in the
presence of safe interlocking tables and in erroneous ones. The
simulation shows that errors are detected already by simulation when
the wrong tables are used.

It is less clear what the model checking does. 
DONE *** MR ***

On the positive side:

+ The paper is well written.

+ As far as I know, this is the fist time Maude or Real-Time Maude
has been used in the train domain, so there is sufficient novel
contribution in the paper. 
DONE *** MR ***

+ Seems to cover "all ERTMS subsystems," whatever that means.
DONE  *** MR ***

+ A perfect fit for the workshop.

+ Underlying work seems to involve industrial collaboration.

On the negative side:

DONE: There is a nontrivial but neither very serious problem in the modeling:
some actions (dynamic behaviors), that should be modeled as rewrite rules,
are modeled as equations. This is not only conceptually ugly, but might also
question some results of the analysis. I am talking about the "equation" on the bottom
of page 8, where a message "routeRequest" is read and consumed, which is a clearly
a dynamic irreversible "action", yet is modeled as an equation. The same applies
to the "equation" on the middle of page 9.  *** Phil (see above)***

- The analysis is unsatisfactory. The good thing is that the paper analyzes
a "correct" scheme plan and then "uncorrect" scheme plans. Already simulation
finds the error in the latter.  Fine. But the model checking part is essentially
absent. What is the model checking command? What were the results of the model
checking? Did you model check both the correct and incorrect settings? 
DONE *** MR ***

- There are a number of fairly simplifying assumptions, but I guess that is
OK in a first analysis of such a complex system. *** MR ***

Detailed comments: *** Phil ***

Done: Page 1, next-to-last paragraph: "these systems can be treated": what does
"these" refer to?

Just write "Section 5".

Monika:
- text after last piece of code: this is confusing, since you have already
declared "set tick def 1 ." Maybe move some of the explanation to above
this last declaration and then explain why you choose this particular
tick method.


Done: paragraph 3 (Section 4):
- "comprising of all": remove "of"
- could you briefly mention why only considering uni-directional rails
is not too much of a simplification
- "We also make the standard assumption that trains have no length" :-)
Is this really a standard assumption (maybe give reference?). Trains in, e.g.,
USA and Mauretania can be pretty long, but maybe not so in Europe?

Done: Page 7, last line: this equation already appears on page 6; remove one occurrence,
probably the one on p6.

Done: Page 8 and elsewhere: Subsubsection headers like "Controller" and "Interlocking" should end with a
period (".") in LNCS.

Done: Page 11:
Nothing needed (Yes is the answer)- Is it really called "finitisation"?
- "counter example" is one word: "counterexample"

- The canonical reference to Maude is the book "All About Maude".
Please use that instead of 4.

Done: Ref 10 and 13: capitalize "Real-Time Maude"

- Refs 11 and 15: these appeared at the same event. Why is their
publication info (years etc) so different?

PAPER: 21
TITLE: Towards safety analysis of ERTMS/ETCS Level 2 in Real-Time   Maude
AUTHORS: Phillip James, Andrew Lawrence, Markus Roggenbach and Monika Seisenberger

OVERALL EVALUATION: 0 (borderline paper)

----------- REVIEW -----------
This paper describes an application of the Real-Time Maude based model
checking approach to the application of railway systems. In
particular, it allows modeling and checking safety conditions about
train stations with multiple tracks and multiple trains on those. This
is an abstraction of the railway standard called ERTMS/ETCS.

The paper does not provide any novel approach or improvement on the
basic technique of Real-Time Maude, but rather is a case study on the
usability of the approach. With this in mind, it does a good job
motivating why this is important and does provide a nice description
of the selected railway stations.

It would of course be nice to have a
larger amount of station types and multiple trains.
DONE *** MR ***

The combination of simulation and error injection provides good
understanding of what can happen, and what can go wrong if any input
is not properly validated. 

Conceptually I am a bit worried about trains of 0 length, which I do
not believe is a standard assumption. If I am wrong, please do provide
a reference in your paper where you make that statement. Combining
that with only 50m distance between trains is a danger.
DONE *** MR ***

--- Abstraction is: Trains shorter than any track length in the scheme plan. Refer to SCP.

The related work section only states what other approaches do, but
does not actually compare them to this work. Please address this.

Detailed comments to the authors *** Monika ***

Ensure that you use 'braking' and 'breaking' correctly throughout. 

poses a number research -> poses a number of research

train's breaking point -> train's braking point

conditions a a route -> conditions a route

made us to favour Maude -> made us choose Maude (?)

verification real-time systems -> verification of real-time systems

overview of our model first we discuss -> overview of our model. First we discuss

implementation level a subsystem -> implementation level of a subsystem


Make your references consistent, for example, 'real-time maude' should be capitalized.

PAPER: 21
TITLE: Towards safety analysis of ERTMS/ETCS Level 2 in Real-Time   Maude
AUTHORS: Phillip James, Andrew Lawrence, Markus Roggenbach and Monika Seisenberger

OVERALL EVALUATION: 2 (accept)

----------- REVIEW -----------

The paper describes the modeling and verification of an ERTMS system
using Real-Time Maude.  The model integrates all the ERTMS subsystems:
Controller, Interlocking, RBC, Trains and Track equipment.  The model
is hybrid and allows to model notions of time and distance. These
notions are central in an ERTMS system as the system grants
authorizations to move to the trains in terms of speed and distances
(EoA). The train objects (Maude is OO) permanently calculates its
position and speed based on the elapsed time. The freedom of collision
property is then expressed in term of distance: there is at any time a
distance of minimum 100m between any two trains.  The paper describes
the principles and architecture of ERTMS, introduces Real-Time Maude,
describes the model of ERTMS in Maude, and gives simulation and
verification results for models of three different track plans,
including examples of configuration mistakes for all the ERTMS
subsystems.

Pros:

- The work is very valuable and original. This is probably the first
  time that the physical movements of the train is modelled in the
  framework of ERTMS data application verification.

- Well-written, well-organized and easy to read.

- Good use of the 15 pages in order to trace their reasoning from the
  ERTMS subsystems to error detection.

- Accurate and detailed description of the ERTMS subsystems and their
  application data.

- Complete explanation of the Maude code modelling the main elements
  (objects) of the ERTMS subsystems.

- Validation section giving confidence in the whole model involving:
  the train, the Interlocking and the RBC.

- Error injection showing that errors can be found and displayed by
  mean of counter examples.

Cons:

Done: The paper contains a lot of Maude code without enough explanation.
  A lot of knowledge of Maude is assumed, and furthermore
  type/sort/operation identifiers are introduced without
  explanation. See details below. *** Phil re-read and cross reference with below ***

- The model makes the "standard assumption" that the trains have no
  length. Zero-length assumption seems quite strong, considering that
  the verified property is then a safety distance of 50m between
  trains.  A common assumption is rather that trains have "rubber
  length". 

DONE *** MR (as above) ***

Done (already present in future work): Performance of the verification in terms of time looks promising for
  the future verification of larger stations, but the stations
  modelled for the case study are all unidirectional. Modelling
  bidirectional stations will increase the complexity of both the
  Interlocking and RBC objects. *** Phil Add this to Future work ***

Done (intro to section 4): The article doesn’t say how the Maude model was built from the
  scheme plan tables: was it written manually or automatically
  generated by mean of a dedicated tool? *** Phil ***

  differ form 'Configuration'? DONE What is 'TimeInf'?  DONE *** Monika ***
